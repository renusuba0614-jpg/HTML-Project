    <p>Welcome back, Java learners!

Following up on our previous video about inheritance, this one dives deeper into the various types of inheritance in Java.

In this video, we will explore types of inheritance and how it's used.

We are starting with Single Inheritance, In single inheritance we are going to learn how one class can directly inherit from another.

And we are moving to the second type Multilevel Inheritance, In this type we will discover how classes can form a chain of inheritance, where a class inherits from another class that is also a subclass of a third class.</p>
